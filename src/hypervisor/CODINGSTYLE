# azuepke, 2013-11-22: added naming rules

The following rules SHALL apply:
- we use C99
- we use (a limited set of) GNU GCC extensions
- gotos are allowed

Formatting:
- indent with TABs
- tabsize 4
- for functions, the opening { goes on the next line
- for if, for, while blocks, the opening { goes on the same line
- even single line ifs and elses should have brackets

	int foo(int bar)
	{
		if (bar == 42) {
			return bar - 11;
		} if else (bar == 13) {
			return bar + 47;
		} else {
			return bar * 7;
		}
	}

- lines are limited to 80 chars in width (up to 100 chars is OK, sometimes)
- no dangling whitespaces at the ends of lines.
- switch ... case: every case should have a break, return, goto
  or /* FALL-THROUGH */ comment

Naming:
- the general naming rule is: lower_case_with_underscores
- typedef'd types have an additional _t postfix
- structs with an according typedef have a _str postfix
- use of "struct foo" is preferred to "foo_t" for structs

Comments:
- don't comment obvious stuff
- use doxygen compatible comments to document interfaces
